    "title": "What Happens to Sample Statistics?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Let’s start from the basics: The idea is to gather data to make an inference about the population. We use what we know (sample data) to estimate what we don’t (population).\nSo, let’s see what happens as one collects more data.\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n\nfor n in range(10, 101, 10):\n    sampled = np.random.normal(loc=100, scale=15, size=n)\n    print('Sampling ' + str(n) + ' observations')\n    print('Mean: ' + str(np.mean(sampled)))\n    print('Standard Deviation ' + str(np.std(sampled)))\n    print('\\n')\n\nAs one increases the sample size taken from the population, sample statistics will approach towards the population parameter.\nDOES NOT NECESSARILY DECREASE! (do not confuse std_dev and std_err) As one can see from the example above!\nBut standard error WILL decrease as the sample size increases. It should make sense intuitively: I have more confidence in my estimates if I know more.\n\nfor n in range(10, 101, 10):\n    sampled = np.random.normal(loc=100, scale=15, size=n)\n    print('Sampling ' + str(n) + ' observations')\n    std_err = np.std(sampled) / np.sqrt(n)\n    print('Standard error approximation: ' + str(std_err))\n    print('\\n')\n\nHow close is the approximation? Let’s try it for one sample\n\nn = 51\n\npop = np.random.normal(loc=100, scale=15, size=300000) # Population with normal distribution(mean=100, sd=15)\n\nsampled = np.random.choice(pop, size=n) # randomly sampling\nestimated_mean = np.mean(sampled) # sample mean\nestimated_sd = np.std(sampled) # sample standard deviation\n\nestimated_std_err = np.std(sampled) / n**.5 # estimated standard error, expected variation for my sample statistic.\n\nprint(estimated_mean, estimated_sd, estimated_std_err)\n\n\n# Let's take many samples and estimate the mean\n\nmean_estimates = []\n\nfor i in range(1000): # Let's do it 1000 times, sampling 51 in each iteration.\n    sampled = np.random.choice(pop, size=n)\n    mean_estimates.append(np.mean(sampled))\n\nnp.std(mean_estimates)\n\nAs one can see, it’s not that far away.\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\n\ng = sns.swarmplot(data=mean_estimates, orient=\"h\", size=6, alpha=.8, color=\"purple\", linewidth=0.5,\n                 edgecolor=\"black\")\n\nWhat happens when one lowers the sample size? More variation, less confidence. As the sample size increases the estimates approach towards the parameter, so with large sample size each sample ends up having similar estimates. However, that’s not the case with low sample size.\n\nn = 16\nmean_estimates = []\n\nfor i in range(1000): # Let's do it 1000 times\n    sampled = np.random.choice(pop, size=n)\n    mean_estimates.append(np.mean(sampled))\n\nnp.std(mean_estimates)\n\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\n\ng = sns.swarmplot(data=mean_estimates, orient=\"h\", size=6, alpha=.8, color=\"purple\", linewidth=0.5,\n                 edgecolor=\"black\")\n\nWatch out the x-axis, it’s much wider now.\n\nmean_estimates = {\n        16:[],\n        23:[],\n        30:[],\n        51:[],\n        84:[],\n        101:[]\n    }\n\nfor n in [16, 23, 30, 51, 84, 101]:\n    for i in range(500):\n        sampled = np.random.choice(pop, size=n)\n        mean_estimates[n].append(np.mean(sampled))\n\n\nfor key in mean_estimates.keys():\n    print('Sample size: ' + str(key))\n    print('Standard deviation (std_err) around the estimates: ' + str(np.std(mean_estimates[key])))\n    print('\\n')"

    "text": "The Start\nDuring my first year at university, I spent a semester break in Beirut, Lebanon, where I earned a human biomechanics trainer certificate. I’d been training basketball players at various levels, including those in the Turkish Basketball League (TBL). While in Beirut, I often heard about the impact of prolonged stress on human health. This led me to watch Dr. Robert Sapolsky’s TED Talk, The Biology of Our Best and Worst Selves, and I thought, “I want to understand human behavior the way he does.”"

    "text": "Getting Into Psychology Lab\nI began watching Stanford’s Human Behavioral Biology courses online. While intriguing, I found the material challenging without a background in the field. To get answers, I reached out to my university’s Psychology Department, where I met Dr. Hasan Bahçekapılı and Dr. Onurcan Yılmaz. Soon, I was visiting Dr. Yılmaz’s office regularly to discuss topics related to psychology, and I grew fascinated with his research interests—especially how morality, politics, religion, and decision-making intersect. Gradually, I shifted my focus from behavioral biology to social and evolutionary psychology. When he offered me a spot in the lab (MINT Lab) he was forming, I jumped at the opportunity."

Although enjoyable, I quickly realized, once we started reading research papers, that I needed a solid ground in statistics to evaluate them. As an English Literature major, I needed a resource that started from scratch, and OpenIntro Statistics and Learning Stats with JASP became essential guides for me. Studying statistics was unexpectedly enjoyable, and I decided to develop my skills further."

Fortunately, I connected with Dr. Basar Coşkunoğlu, whom I knew through playing Hearthstone. With his patient guidance, I started with basics like functions and inequalities, eventually advancing to calculus and linear algebra. We reached a point where I could continue independently, and I still study linear algebra occasionally, using my notes, Mathematics for Machine Learning, and Gilbert Strang’s works."

Wanting broader experience, I sought a part-time role or long-term internship to balance with school. I started building a project portfolio and applied to various positions. Many interviews revealed that prospective employers lacked data science teams, which felt limiting for my first role. Finally, I applied for and was accepted to DenizBank’s data science internship program."

I am hoping to use this place to share the stuff that I learn, it makes me develop an intuition and I feel like I learn better.\nMain things that I think about blogging fall under statistics (both frequentist and Bayesian methods), machine learning, and psychology (less frequently).\nAim of this blog is to make this place a useful place for the mentioned topics above, while improving myself on them as well. I hope you find this place useful."
