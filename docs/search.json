    "text": "Let’s start from the basics: The idea is to gather data to make an inference about the population.

(do not confuse std_dev and std_err) As one can see from the example above!\nBut standard error WILL decrease as the sample size increases. It should make sense intuitively: I have more confidence in my estimates if I know more.\n\nfor n in range(10, 101, 10):\n    sampled = np.random.normal(loc=100, scale=15, size=n)\n    print('Sampling ' + str(n) + ' observations')\n    std_err = np.std(sampled) / np.sqrt(n)\n    print('Standard error approximation: ' + str(std_err))\n    print('\\n')\n\nSampling 10 observations\nStandard error approximation: 4.452823707231046\n\n\nSampling 20 observations\nStandard error approximation: 3.798915557039333\n\n\nSampling 30 observations\nStandard error approximation: 2.3932757697459746\n\n\nSampling 40 observations\nStandard error approximation: 2.624220779126406\n\n\nSampling 50 observations\nStandard error approximation: 2.2840746792281217\n\n\nSampling 60 observations\nStandard error approximation: 2.015124706208566\n\n\nSampling 70 observations\nStandard error approximation: 1.7230901229016737\n\n\nSampling 80 observations\nStandard error approximation: 1.5993946754011168\n\n\nSampling 90 observations\nStandard error approximation: 1.66349862578967\n\n\nSampling 100 observations\nStandard error approximation: 1.577820207327762\n\n\n\n\nHow close is the approximation?

    "text": "The Start\nDuring my first year at university, I spent a semester break in Beirut, Lebanon, where I earned a human biomechanics trainer certificate. I’d been training basketball players at various levels, including those in the Turkish Basketball League (TBL). While in Beirut, I often heard about the impact of prolonged stress on human health. This led me to watch Dr. Robert Sapolsky’s TED Talk, The Biology of Our Best and Worst Selves, and I thought, “I want to understand human behavior the way he does.”"

To get answers, I reached out to my university’s Psychology Department, where I met Dr. Hasan Bahçekapılı and Dr. Onurcan Yılmaz. Soon, I was visiting Dr. Yılmaz’s office regularly to discuss topics related to psychology, and I grew fascinated with his research interests—especially how morality, politics, religion, and decision-making intersect. Gradually, I shifted my focus from behavioral biology to social and evolutionary psychology. When he offered me a spot in the lab (MINT Lab) he was forming, I jumped at the opportunity."

Studying statistics was unexpectedly enjoyable, and I decided to develop my skills further."
