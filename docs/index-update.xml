<p>Some time ago, I stumbled upon the website <a href="https://darrylblackport.com/"><em>Less Certainty, More Inquiry</em></a>. If you click on the link, you’ll see that Darryl Blackport shares what he listens to or reads every week of the year. I found the concept intriguing and thought it would be a great fit for me, as I’m often immersed in studying or reading something.</p>
<p>This year, I’m taking inspiration from his approach. I’ll share what I study each month, providing a brief overview of the topics I’ve explored, focusing on what I found particularly interesting or useful. To kick things off, here are my learning goals for 2025. Let’s dive in.<br>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-to-learn-in-2025-deep-learning">What to Learn in 2025: Deep Learning</h3>
<p>For most of my data science journey, I’ve taken a theory-first approach, focusing heavily on statistics. However, with recent advancements in tools like LLMs, I think it’s time for a shift. In 2025, I plan to delve into deep learning (a domain I’ve avoided so far) with a hands-on approach.</p>
<p>Here’s my roadmap for deep learning:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/"><em>Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow</em></a><br>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-to-learn-in-2025-sports-analytics">What to Learn in 2025: Sports Analytics</h3>
<p>I’ve been passionate about sports analytics for nearly a year now and have made significant strides in basketball analytics. (You can check out some of my work <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yigitasik/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>This year, I aim to expand my focus by creating videos on football (soccer) analytics, in addition to basketball, on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@yigasIRL">YouTube channel</a>. To prepare for this, I’ve started the following specialization:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/sports-analytics">Sports Performance Analytics Specialization</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, Dean Oliver’s new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Basketball-beyond-Paper-Analytics-Revolution/dp/1496240499"><em>Basketball Beyond Paper</em></a>, is on my reading list—it’s a must-read for anyone in this space.<br>

<section id="what-to-learn-in-2025-statistics" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-to-learn-in-2025-statistics">What to Learn in 2025: Statistics</h3>
<p>I consider statistics to be one of my stronger skills compared to other data scientists in the industry (at least in Turkey), but there’s always room for growth.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m halfway through <a href="https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkBayes2/"><em>Think Bayes</em></a>, and I’m looking forward to Tom Faulkenberry’s <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Bayesian-Statistics-The-Basics/Faulkenberry/p/book/9781032744001">upcoming book</a> when it’s released.</p>
<p>There are specific topics, like meta-analysis, that I want to strengthen, but I don’t plan to tackle them systematically. Instead, I’ll explore them as curiosity strikes.<br>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-to-learn-in-2025-production-level-data-science-maybe">What to Learn in 2025: Production-Level Data Science (Maybe)</h3>
<p>This one’s a “maybe.” Deep learning and LLMs are higher priorities, and the list is already packed. However, gaining production-level data science expertise could be beneficial in the long run.</p>
<p>For now, it’s something I’ll keep on the back burner, but we’ll see how the year unfolds.<br>

<p>This blog post was polished with help of ChatGPT! I write the whole piece and feed it to ChatGPT to improve the flow.</p>
<p>And that’s pretty much it for my 2025 learning goals. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
