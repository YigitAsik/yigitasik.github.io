## Man on A Mission Series

Back in the day, can't remember exactly when, I ran across the following website: [*Less Certainty, More Inquiry*](https://darrylblackport.com/).
If you have clicked on it, you can see Darryl Blackport shares what he has listened or read for every week of the year. I really liked it, feels like it's a good fit for me as well since I am usually reading/studying something. So, this year I will be doing something similar: I'll share what I study every month, explaining the things that I have gone through briefly and stick to stuff that I found relatively more interesting or more useful. On this starter, I'll write down my aims for the 2025 (in terms of topics to learn). Let's go.

### What to Learn in 2025: Deep Learning

For the majority of my data science journey, I have taken the theory-first approach and sticked to the statistics-heavy stuff. Due to latest progress in variety of tools such as LLMs, I feel like it's the right time for a change: I aim to dive into deep learning (something that I avoided so far) and take a hands-on approach. Hence, here's the following roadmap for deep learning:
* [*Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)
* [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
* [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

### What to Learn in 2025: Sports Analytics

I have been interested in sports analytics for almost a year now and done quite a lot of stuff in terms of basketball analytics (some of them can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yigitasik/)). During this new year, I want to start making videos related to football (soccer) analytics on top of basketball analytics [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@yigasIRL). To achieve that, I started the following specialization:
* [Sports Performance Analytics Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/sports-analytics)

Also, Dean Oliver came up with a new book: [*Basketball Beyond Paper*](https://www.amazon.com/Basketball-beyond-Paper-Analytics-Revolution/dp/1496240499)
Gotta squeeze this one as well.

### What to Learn in 2025: Statistics

I believe statistics is my strong suit compared to other data scientists in the industry (at least in Turkey), but nothing is ever enough. I am currently halfway through [*Think Bayes*](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkBayes2/) and definitely will take a look at Tom Faulkenberry's [upcoming book](https://www.routledge.com/Bayesian-Statistics-The-Basics/Faulkenberry/p/book/9781032744001) when it comes out. There are certain topics that I want to be more sound, such as meta-analysis, but I don't plan on studying them in a systematic way (i.e., going to take a look whenever I want).

### What to Learn in 2025: Production Level DS (maybe)

Yea, that's a maybe. Deep learning and some LLM knowledge has higher priority compared to this one the list already feels crowded. However, it seems to me that production level DS knowledge may benefit me in the long run. We'll see.
